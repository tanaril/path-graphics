                <h1>World Without Wars and Violence</h1>
                <p class="type">Website</p>
                <p class="work">Visual Design, UI Design, information architecture</p>
                <p class="description">This website was designed in 2013, for the greek hub of World without Wars and Violence organization. They wanted a fresh redesign and a new information architecture approach, due to the mass information they provide in their current site, which can't handle anymore. This site is still under construction, but here is a sense of how it will look like. </p>
                <div class="main-visual">
                    <div class="imac">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h2>Website colour palette</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p class="description">Due to the informative character of the site and the minimal approach, I have decided to use only some tints of grey, additionally to the basic colour of the organization logo. </p>

                <h2>Visual design</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p class="description">It was decided to have a flat and minimal approach for the design, which will rather focus on the information. In their home page they wanted all the new articles to be shown, as well as a calendar which will show the upcoming events for their members or other people who are interested in.</p>
