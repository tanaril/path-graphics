                <p class="description">This website was redesigned in 2013, for the greek hub of the global organization "World without Wars and Violence". It was not only requested  a new approach of the design but also of the information architecture, due to the mass information that can't be handled on the current site. This site is still under construction, but here is a sense of how it will look like. </p>
                <div class="main-visual">
                    <div class="imac">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h2>Website colour palette</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p class="description">As the main focus of the site is on the information, it was decided to use only some tints and shades of grey, additionally to the basic blue colour of the organization logo. </p>
                
               <img class="palette" src="/images/page/world-without-war/web-palette.png" />
                
                <h2>Visual design</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p class="description">The design has a flat and minimal approach, which will rather focus on the information. In the home page the new articles are shown, as well as a calendar with the upcoming events of the organization.</p>
