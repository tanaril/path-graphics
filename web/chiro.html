                <p class="description">This site was created in 2012 for the children's camp in Zwijnaarde. The main purpose of this site was the presentation of the details of the upcoming events, for the children and their parents, as well as the information of each youth group's role and of the leaders. Due to the slow working of the organization on the texts and the material of the pages, it's currently offline.  </p>
