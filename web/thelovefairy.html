                <p class="description">The Love Fairy was an idea of an acquitance of mine which is planned to run in all the digital forms. For the begnning though it was decided to run on the web only, with the thought of a future mobile app. The idea is similar to a dating site, but with the big difference of knowing the person who gets your request. It was designed in 2013 and its still under development, although its online.</p>

                <p class="description">The logo was created to have a playful character. The font that has been used is rounded and light, while some tones of grey have been used to add on the lightness and make the fairy graphic to pop out. For the site, shades of grey have been used additionally to the cherry and blue colours which represent the genders.</p>
